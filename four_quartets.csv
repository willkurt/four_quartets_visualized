BURNT NORTON,I,Time present and time past
BURNT NORTON,I,"Are both perhaps present in time future,"
BURNT NORTON,I,And time future contained in time past.
BURNT NORTON,I,If all time is eternally present
BURNT NORTON,I,All time is unredeemable.
BURNT NORTON,I,What might have been is an abstraction
BURNT NORTON,I,Remaining a perpetual possibility
BURNT NORTON,I,Only in a world of speculation.
BURNT NORTON,I,What might have been and what has been
BURNT NORTON,I,"Point to one end, which is always present."
BURNT NORTON,I,Footfalls echo in the memory
BURNT NORTON,I,Down the passage which we did not take
BURNT NORTON,I,Towards the door we never opened
BURNT NORTON,I,Into the rose-garden. My words echo
BURNT NORTON,I,"Thus, in your mind."
BURNT NORTON,I,But to what purpose
BURNT NORTON,I,Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
BURNT NORTON,I,I do not know.
BURNT NORTON,I,Other echoes
BURNT NORTON,I,Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
BURNT NORTON,I,"Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"Round the corner. Through the first gate,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"Into our first world, shall we follow"
BURNT NORTON,I,The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
BURNT NORTON,I,"There they were, dignified, invisible,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"And the bird called, in response to"
BURNT NORTON,I,"The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses"
BURNT NORTON,I,Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
BURNT NORTON,I,"There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting."
BURNT NORTON,I,"So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"Along the empty alley, into the box circle,"
BURNT NORTON,I,To look down into the drained pool.
BURNT NORTON,I,"Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"The surface glittered out of heart of light,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"And they were behind us, reflected in the pool."
BURNT NORTON,I,"Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty."
BURNT NORTON,I,"Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,"
BURNT NORTON,I,"Hidden excitedly, containing laughter."
BURNT NORTON,I,"Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind"
BURNT NORTON,I,Cannot bear very much reality.
BURNT NORTON,I,Time past and time future
BURNT NORTON,I,What might have been and what has been
BURNT NORTON,I,"Point to one end, which is always present."
BURNT NORTON,II,Garlic and sapphires in the mud
BURNT NORTON,II,Clot the bedded axle-tree.
BURNT NORTON,II,The trilling wire in the blood
BURNT NORTON,II,Sings below inveterate scars
BURNT NORTON,II,Appeasing long forgotten wars.
BURNT NORTON,II,The dance along the artery
BURNT NORTON,II,The circulation of the lymph
BURNT NORTON,II,Are figured in the drift of stars
BURNT NORTON,II,Ascend to summer in the tree
BURNT NORTON,II,We move above the moving tree
BURNT NORTON,II,In light upon the figured leaf
BURNT NORTON,II,And hear upon the sodden floor
BURNT NORTON,II,"Below, the boarhound and the boar"
BURNT NORTON,II,Pursue their pattern as before
BURNT NORTON,II,But reconciled among the stars.
BURNT NORTON,II,At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
BURNT NORTON,II,"Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"There would be no dance, and there is only the dance."
BURNT NORTON,II,"I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where."
BURNT NORTON,II,"And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time."
BURNT NORTON,II,"The inner freedom from the practical desire,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"The release from action and suffering, release from the inner"
BURNT NORTON,II,"And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded"
BURNT NORTON,II,"By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"Erhebung without motion, concentration"
BURNT NORTON,II,"Without elimination, both a new world"
BURNT NORTON,II,"And the old made explicit, understood"
BURNT NORTON,II,"In the completion of its partial ecstasy,"
BURNT NORTON,II,The resolution of its partial horror.
BURNT NORTON,II,Yet the enchainment of past and future
BURNT NORTON,II,"Woven in the weakness of the changing body,"
BURNT NORTON,II,Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
BURNT NORTON,II,Which flesh cannot endure.
BURNT NORTON,II,Time past and time future
BURNT NORTON,II,Allow but a little consciousness.
BURNT NORTON,II,To be conscious is not to be in time
BURNT NORTON,II,"But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,"
BURNT NORTON,II,"The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,"
BURNT NORTON,II,The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
BURNT NORTON,II,Be remembered; involved with past and future.
BURNT NORTON,II,Only through time time is conquered.
BURNT NORTON,III,Here is a place of disaffection
BURNT NORTON,III,Time before and time after
BURNT NORTON,III,In a dim light: neither daylight
BURNT NORTON,III,Investing form with lucid stillness
BURNT NORTON,III,Turning shadow into transient beauty
BURNT NORTON,III,With slow rotation suggesting permanence
BURNT NORTON,III,Nor darkness to purify the soul
BURNT NORTON,III,Emptying the sensual with deprivation
BURNT NORTON,III,Cleansing affection from the temporal.
BURNT NORTON,III,Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
BURNT NORTON,III,Over the strained time-ridden faces
BURNT NORTON,III,Distracted from distraction by distraction
BURNT NORTON,III,Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
BURNT NORTON,III,Tumid apathy with no concentration
BURNT NORTON,III,"Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind"
BURNT NORTON,III,"That blows before and after time,"
BURNT NORTON,III,Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs
BURNT NORTON,III,Time before and time after.
BURNT NORTON,III,Eructation of unhealthy souls
BURNT NORTON,III,"Into the faded air, the torpid"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Not here the darkness, in this twittering world."
BURNT NORTON,III,"Descend lower, descend only"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Into the world of perpetual solitude,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"World not world, but that which is not world,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Internal darkness, deprivation"
BURNT NORTON,III,"And destitution of all property,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Desiccation of the world of sense,"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Evacuation of the world of fancy,"
BURNT NORTON,III,Inoperancy of the world of spirit;
BURNT NORTON,III,"This is the one way, and the other"
BURNT NORTON,III,"Is the same, not in movement"
BURNT NORTON,III,But abstention from movement; while the world moves
BURNT NORTON,III,"In appetency, on its metalled ways"
BURNT NORTON,III,Of time past and time future.
BURNT NORTON,IV,"Time and the bell have buried the day,"
BURNT NORTON,IV,The black cloud carries the sun away.
BURNT NORTON,IV,"Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis"
BURNT NORTON,IV,"Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray"
BURNT NORTON,IV,Clutch and cling?
BURNT NORTON,IV,Chill
BURNT NORTON,IV,Fingers of yew be curled
BURNT NORTON,IV,Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing
BURNT NORTON,IV,"Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still"
BURNT NORTON,IV,At the still point of the turning world.
BURNT NORTON,V,"Words move, music moves"
BURNT NORTON,V,Only in time; but that which is only living
BURNT NORTON,V,"Can only die. Words, after speech, reach"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,"
BURNT NORTON,V,Can words or music reach
BURNT NORTON,V,"The stillness, as a Chinese jar still"
BURNT NORTON,V,Moves perpetually in its stillness.
BURNT NORTON,V,"Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Not that only, but the co-existence,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Or say that the end precedes the beginning,"
BURNT NORTON,V,And the end and the beginning were always there
BURNT NORTON,V,Before the beginning and after the end.
BURNT NORTON,V,"And all is always now. Words strain,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,"
BURNT NORTON,V,Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
BURNT NORTON,V,"Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,"
BURNT NORTON,V,Always assail them. The Word in the desert
BURNT NORTON,V,"Is most attacked by voices of temptation,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"The crying shadow in the funeral dance,"
BURNT NORTON,V,The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.
BURNT NORTON,V,"The detail of the pattern is movement,"
BURNT NORTON,V,As in the figure of the ten stairs.
BURNT NORTON,V,Desire itself is movement
BURNT NORTON,V,Not in itself desirable;
BURNT NORTON,V,"Love is itself unmoving,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Only the cause and end of movement,"
BURNT NORTON,V,"Timeless, and undesiring"
BURNT NORTON,V,Except in the aspect of time
BURNT NORTON,V,Caught in the form of limitation
BURNT NORTON,V,Between un-being and being.
BURNT NORTON,V,Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
BURNT NORTON,V,Even while the dust moves
BURNT NORTON,V,There rises the hidden laughter
BURNT NORTON,V,Of children in the foliage
BURNT NORTON,V,"Quick now, here, now, always—"
BURNT NORTON,V,Ridiculous the waste sad time
BURNT NORTON,V,Stretching before and after.
EAST COKER,I,In my beginning is my end. In succession
EAST COKER,I,"Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,"
EAST COKER,I,"Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place"
EAST COKER,I,"Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass."
EAST COKER,I,"Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,"
EAST COKER,I,"Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth"
EAST COKER,I,"Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,"
EAST COKER,I,"Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf."
EAST COKER,I,Houses live and die: there is a time for building
EAST COKER,I,And a time for living and for generation
EAST COKER,I,And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane
EAST COKER,I,And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots
EAST COKER,I,And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.
EAST COKER,I,In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls
EAST COKER,I,"Across the open field, leaving the deep lane"
EAST COKER,I,"Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,"
EAST COKER,I,"Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,"
EAST COKER,I,And the deep lane insists on the direction
EAST COKER,I,"Into the village, in the electric heat"
EAST COKER,I,Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light
EAST COKER,I,"Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone."
EAST COKER,I,The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.
EAST COKER,I,Wait for the early owl.
EAST COKER,I,In that open field
EAST COKER,I,"If you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,"
EAST COKER,I,"On a summer midnight, you can hear the music"
EAST COKER,I,Of the weak pipe and the little drum
EAST COKER,I,And see them dancing around the bonfire
EAST COKER,I,The association of man and woman
EAST COKER,I,"In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie—"
EAST COKER,I,A dignified and commodiois sacrament.
EAST COKER,I,"Two and two, necessarye coniunction,"
EAST COKER,I,Holding eche other by the hand or the arm
EAST COKER,I,Whiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire
EAST COKER,I,"Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles,"
EAST COKER,I,Rustically solemn or in rustic laughter
EAST COKER,I,"Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,"
EAST COKER,I,"Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth"
EAST COKER,I,Mirth of those long since under earth
EAST COKER,I,"Nourishing the corn. Keeping time,"
EAST COKER,I,Keeping the rhythm in their dancing
EAST COKER,I,As in their living in the living seasons
EAST COKER,I,The time of the seasons and the constellations
EAST COKER,I,The time of milking and the time of harvest
EAST COKER,I,The time of the coupling of man and woman
EAST COKER,I,And that of beasts. Feet rising and falling.
EAST COKER,I,Eating and drinking. Dung and death.
EAST COKER,I,"Dawn points, and another day"
EAST COKER,I,Prepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind
EAST COKER,I,Wrinkles and slides. I am here
EAST COKER,I,"Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning."
EAST COKER,II,What is the late November doing
EAST COKER,II,With the disturbance of the spring
EAST COKER,II,"And creatures of the summer heat,"
EAST COKER,II,And snowdrops writhing under feet
EAST COKER,II,And hollyhocks that aim too high
EAST COKER,II,Red into grey and tumble down
EAST COKER,II,Late roses filled with early snow?
EAST COKER,II,Thunder rolled by the rolling stars
EAST COKER,II,Simulates triumphal cars
EAST COKER,II,Deployed in constellated wars
EAST COKER,II,Scorpion fights against the Sun
EAST COKER,II,Until the Sun and Moon go down
EAST COKER,II,Comets weep and Leonids fly
EAST COKER,II,Hunt the heavens and the plains
EAST COKER,II,Whirled in a vortex that shall bring
EAST COKER,II,The world to that destructive fire
EAST COKER,II,Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.
EAST COKER,II,That was a way of putting it—not very satisfactory:
EAST COKER,II,"A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,"
EAST COKER,II,Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle
EAST COKER,II,With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.
EAST COKER,II,It was not (to start again) what one had expected.
EAST COKER,II,"What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,"
EAST COKER,II,"Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity"
EAST COKER,II,And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us
EAST COKER,II,"Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,"
EAST COKER,II,Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?
EAST COKER,II,"The serenity only a deliberate hebetude,"
EAST COKER,II,The wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets
EAST COKER,II,Useless in the darkness into which they peered
EAST COKER,II,"Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,"
EAST COKER,II,"At best, only a limited value"
EAST COKER,II,In the knowledge derived from experience.
EAST COKER,II,"The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,"
EAST COKER,II,For the pattern is new in every moment
EAST COKER,II,And every moment is a new and shocking
EAST COKER,II,Valuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived
EAST COKER,II,"Of that which, deceiving, could no longer harm."
EAST COKER,II,"In the middle, not only in the middle of the way"
EAST COKER,II,"But all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,"
EAST COKER,II,"On the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold,"
EAST COKER,II,"And menaced by monsters, fancy lights,"
EAST COKER,II,Risking enchantment. Do not let me hear
EAST COKER,II,"Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,"
EAST COKER,II,"Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,"
EAST COKER,II,"Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God."
EAST COKER,II,The only wisdom we can hope to acquire
EAST COKER,II,Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.
EAST COKER,II,The houses are all gone under the sea.
EAST COKER,II,The dancers are all gone under the hill.
EAST COKER,III,"O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,"
EAST COKER,III,"The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,"
EAST COKER,III,"The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,"
EAST COKER,III,"The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,"
EAST COKER,III,"Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,"
EAST COKER,III,"Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,"
EAST COKER,III,"And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha"
EAST COKER,III,"And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,"
EAST COKER,III,And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.
EAST COKER,III,"And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,"
EAST COKER,III,"Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury."
EAST COKER,III,"I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you"
EAST COKER,III,"Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,"
EAST COKER,III,"The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed"
EAST COKER,III,"With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,"
EAST COKER,III,"And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama"
EAST COKER,III,And the bold imposing facade are all being rolled away—
EAST COKER,III,"Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too long between stations"
EAST COKER,III,And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence
EAST COKER,III,And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen
EAST COKER,III,Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;
EAST COKER,III,"Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing—"
EAST COKER,III,"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope"
EAST COKER,III,"For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,"
EAST COKER,III,For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
EAST COKER,III,But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
EAST COKER,III,"Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:"
EAST COKER,III,"So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing."
EAST COKER,III,"Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning."
EAST COKER,III,"The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,"
EAST COKER,III,"The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy"
EAST COKER,III,"Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony"
EAST COKER,III,Of death and birth.
EAST COKER,III,You say I am repeating
EAST COKER,III,Something I have said before. I shall say it again.
EAST COKER,III,"Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there,"
EAST COKER,III,"To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,"
EAST COKER,III,You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy.
EAST COKER,III,In order to arrive at what you do not know
EAST COKER,III,You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.
EAST COKER,III,In order to possess what you do not possess
EAST COKER,III,You must go by the way of dispossession.
EAST COKER,III,In order to arrive at what you are not
EAST COKER,III,You must go through the way in which you are not.
EAST COKER,III,And what you do not know is the only thing you know
EAST COKER,III,And what you own is what you do not own
EAST COKER,III,And where you are is where you are not.
EAST COKER,IV,The wounded surgeon plies the steel
EAST COKER,IV,That questions the distempered part;
EAST COKER,IV,Beneath the bleeding hands we feel
EAST COKER,IV,The sharp compassion of the healer's art
EAST COKER,IV,Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.
EAST COKER,IV,Our only health is the disease
EAST COKER,IV,If we obey the dying nurse
EAST COKER,IV,Whose constant care is not to please
EAST COKER,IV,"But to remind of our, and Adam's curse,"
EAST COKER,IV,"And that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse."
EAST COKER,IV,The whole earth is our hospital
EAST COKER,IV,"Endowed by the ruined millionaire,"
EAST COKER,IV,"Wherein, if we do well, we shall"
EAST COKER,IV,Die of the absolute paternal care
EAST COKER,IV,"That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere."
EAST COKER,IV,"The chill ascends from feet to knees,"
EAST COKER,IV,The fever sings in mental wires.
EAST COKER,IV,"If to be warmed, then I must freeze"
EAST COKER,IV,And quake in frigid purgatorial fires
EAST COKER,IV,"Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars."
EAST COKER,IV,"The dripping blood our only drink,"
EAST COKER,IV,The bloody flesh our only food:
EAST COKER,IV,In spite of which we like to think
EAST COKER,IV,"That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood—"
EAST COKER,IV,"Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good."
EAST COKER,V,"So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years—"
EAST COKER,V,"Twenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres"
EAST COKER,V,"Trying to use words, and every attempt"
EAST COKER,V,"Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure"
EAST COKER,V,Because one has only learnt to get the better of words
EAST COKER,V,"For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which"
EAST COKER,V,One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture
EAST COKER,V,"Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate"
EAST COKER,V,With shabby equipment always deteriorating
EAST COKER,V,"In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,"
EAST COKER,V,Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer
EAST COKER,V,"By strength and submission, has already been discovered"
EAST COKER,V,"Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope"
EAST COKER,V,To emulate—but there is no competition—
EAST COKER,V,There is only the fight to recover what has been lost
EAST COKER,V,"And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions"
EAST COKER,V,That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.
EAST COKER,V,"For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business."
EAST COKER,V,Home is where one starts from. As we grow older
EAST COKER,V,"The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated"
EAST COKER,V,Of dead and living. Not the intense moment
EAST COKER,V,"Isolated, with no before and after,"
EAST COKER,V,But a lifetime burning in every moment
EAST COKER,V,And not the lifetime of one man only
EAST COKER,V,But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.
EAST COKER,V,"There is a time for the evening under starlight,"
EAST COKER,V,A time for the evening under lamplight
EAST COKER,V,(The evening with the photograph album).
EAST COKER,V,Love is most nearly itself
EAST COKER,V,When here and now cease to matter.
EAST COKER,V,Old men ought to be explorers
EAST COKER,V,Here or there does not matter
EAST COKER,V,We must be still and still moving
EAST COKER,V,Into another intensity
EAST COKER,V,"For a further union, a deeper communion"
EAST COKER,V,"Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,"
EAST COKER,V,"The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters"
EAST COKER,V,Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Is a strong brown god—sullen, untamed and intractable,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,Then only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"By the dwellers in cities—ever, however, implacable."
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Keeping his seasons and rages, destroyer, reminder"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Of what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting."
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"In the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"In the smell of grapes on the autumn table,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The river is within us, the sea is all about us;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The sea is the land's edge also, the granite"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Into which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,Its hints of earlier and other creation:
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The pools where it offers to our curiosity
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The more delicate algae and the sea anemone.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"It tosses up our losses, the torn seine,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,Many gods and many voices.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The salt is on the briar rose,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The fog is in the fir trees.
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The sea howl
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"And the sea yelp, are different voices"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Often together heard: the whine in the rigging,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The distant rote in the granite teeth,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,And the wailing warning from the approaching headland
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Rounded homewards, and the seagull:"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,And under the oppression of the silent fog
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The tolling bell
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Ground swell, a time"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Older than the time of chronometers, older"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,Than time counted by anxious worried women
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Lying awake, calculating the future,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"And piece together the past and the future,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"The future futureless, before the morning watch"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,When time stops and time is never ending;
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,"And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,Clangs
THE DRY SALVAGES,I,The bell.
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Where is there an end of it, the soundless wailing,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,The silent withering of autumn flowers
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Dropping their petals and remaining motionless;
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Where is there and end to the drifting wreckage,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"There is no end, but addition: the trailing"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Consequence of further days and hours,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,While emotion takes to itself the emotionless
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Years of living among the breakage
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Of what was believed in as the most reliable—
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,And therefore the fittest for renunciation.
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"There is the final addition, the failing"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Pride or resentment at failing powers,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"The unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"In a drifting boat with a slow leakage,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,The silent listening to the undeniable
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Clamour of the bell of the last annunciation.
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Where is the end of them, the fishermen sailing"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,We cannot think of a time that is oceanless
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Or of an ocean not littered with wastage
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Or of a future that is not liable
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Like the past, to have no destination."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"We have to think of them as forever bailing,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Setting and hauling, while the North East lowers"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Over shallow banks unchanging and erosionless
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Or drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Not as making a trip that will be unpayable
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,For a haul that will not bear examination.
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"No end to the withering of withered flowers,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Prayer of the one Annunciation.
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"It seems, as one becomes older,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence—"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning the past."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"The moments of happiness—not the sense of well-being,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Fruition, fulfilment, security or affection,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Or even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination—"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"We had the experience but missed the meaning,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,And approach to the meaning restores the experience
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"In a different form, beyond any meaning"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,We can assign to happiness. I have said before
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,That the past experience revived in the meaning
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Is not the experience of one life only
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,But of many generations—not forgetting
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Something that is probably quite ineffable:
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,The backward look behind the assurance
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Of recorded history, the backward half-look"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Over the shoulder, towards the primitive terror."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Having hoped for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,Is not in question) are likewise permanent
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,With such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"In the agony of others, nearly experienced,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Involving ourselves, than in our own."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"For our own past is covered by the currents of action,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,But the torment of others remains an experience
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"People change, and smile: but the agony abides."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Time the destroyer is time the preserver,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken coops,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"The bitter apple, and the bite in the apple."
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"And the ragged rock in the restless waters,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,In navigable weather it is always a seamark
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,To lay a course by: but in the sombre season
THE DRY SALVAGES,II,"Or the sudden fury, is what it always was."
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant—
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Among other things—or one way of putting the same thing:
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"That the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Of wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been opened.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"And the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back."
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"You cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,That time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"When the train starts, and the passengers are settled"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"To fruit, periodicals and business letters"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,(And those who saw them off have left the platform)
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Their faces relax from grief into relief,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Into different lives, or into any future;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,You are not the same people who left that station
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Or who will arrive at any terminus,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,And on the deck of the drumming liner
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Watching the furrow that widens behind you,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,You shall not think 'the past is finished'
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Or 'the future is before us'.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"'Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging;"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,You are not those who saw the harbour
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Receding, or those who will disembark."
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Here between the hither and the farther shore
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"While time is withdrawn, consider the future"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,And the past with an equal mind.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,At the moment which is not of action or inaction
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"You can receive this: ""on whatever sphere of being"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,The mind of a man may be intent
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"At the time of death""—that is the one action"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,(And the time of death is every moment)
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Which shall fructify in the lives of others:
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,And do not think of the fruit of action.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,Fare forward.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"O voyagers, O seamen,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"You who came to port, and you whose bodies"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Or whatever event, this is your real destination.'"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,On the field of battle.
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"Not fare well,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,III,"But fare forward, voyagers."
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Lady, whose shrine stands on the promontory,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Pray for all those who are in ships, those"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Whose business has to do with fish, and"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Those concerned with every lawful traffic
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,And those who conduct them.
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Repeat a prayer also on behalf of
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Women who have seen their sons or husbands
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Setting forth, and not returning:"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Figlia del tuo figlio,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Queen of Heaven.
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Also pray for those who were in ships, and"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,"Ended their voyage on the sand, in the sea's lips"
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Or in the dark throat which will not reject them
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Or wherever cannot reach them the sound of the sea bell's
THE DRY SALVAGES,IV,Perpetual angelus.
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"To communicate with Mars, converse with spirits,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"To report the behaviour of the sea monster,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Describe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Observe disease in signatures, evoke"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Biography from the wrinkles of the palm
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,And tragedy from fingers; release omens
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"By sortilege, or tea leaves, riddle the inevitable"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Or barbituric acids, or dissect"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,The recurrent image into pre-conscious terrors—
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"To explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams; all these are usual"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Pastimes and drugs, and features of the press:"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"And always will be, some of them especially"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,When there is distress of nations and perplexity
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Whether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware Road."
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Men's curiosity searches past and future
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,And clings to that dimension. But to apprehend
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,The point of intersection of the timeless
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"With time, is an occupation for the saint—"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"No occupation either, but something given"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"And taken, in a lifetime's death in love,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"For most of us, there is only the unattended"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Moment, the moment in and out of time,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Or the waterfall, or music heard so deeply"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"That it is not heard at all, but you are the music"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"While the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Hints followed by guesses; and the rest
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action."
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation."
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Here the impossible union
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Of spheres of existence is actual,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Here the past and future
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Are conquered, and reconciled,"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Where action were otherwise movement
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Of that which is only moved
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,And has in it no source of movement—
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"Driven by daemonic, chthonic"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Powers. And right action is freedom
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,From past and future also.
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"For most of us, this is the aim"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Never here to be realised;
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Who are only undefeated
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,Because we have gone on trying;
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,"We, content at the last"
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,If our temporal reversion nourish
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,(Not too far from the yew-tree)
THE DRY SALVAGES,V,The life of significant soil.
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Midwinter spring is its own season
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Suspended in time, between pole and tropic."
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"When the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"The brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"In windless cold that is the heart's heat,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Reflecting in a watery mirror
LITTLE GIDDING,I,A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"And glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Stirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,In the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing
LITTLE GIDDING,I,The soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Or smell of living thing. This is the spring time
LITTLE GIDDING,I,But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Is blanched for an hour with transitory blossom
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Of snow, a bloom more sudden"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Than that of summer, neither budding nor fading,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Not in the scheme of generation.
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Where is the summer, the unimaginable"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Zero summer?
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"If you came this way,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Taking the route you would be likely to take
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"From the place you would be likely to come from,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness."
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"It would be the same at the end of the journey,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"If you came at night like a broken king,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"If you came by day not knowing what you came for,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"It would be the same, when you leave the rough road"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,And turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade
LITTLE GIDDING,I,And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Is only a shell, a husk of meaning"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled
LITTLE GIDDING,I,If at all. Either you had no purpose
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured
LITTLE GIDDING,I,And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city—"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"But this is the nearest, in place and time,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Now and in England.
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"If you came this way,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Taking any route, starting from anywhere,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"At any time or at any season,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,It would always be the same: you would have to put off
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Or carry report. You are here to kneel
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Than an order of words, the conscious occupation"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying."
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"And what the dead had no speech for, when living,"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"They can tell you, being dead: the communication"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.
LITTLE GIDDING,I,"Here, the intersection of the timeless moment"
LITTLE GIDDING,I,Is England and nowhere. Never and always.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Ash on and old man's sleeve
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Is all the ash the burnt roses leave.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Dust in the air suspended
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Marks the place where a story ended.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Dust inbreathed was a house—
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"The walls, the wainscot and the mouse,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"The death of hope and despair,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,This is the death of air.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,There are flood and drouth
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Over the eyes and in the mouth,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Dead water and dead sand
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Contending for the upper hand.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,The parched eviscerate soil
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Gapes at the vanity of toil,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Laughs without mirth.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,This is the death of earth.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Water and fire succeed
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"The town, the pasture and the weed."
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Water and fire deride
LITTLE GIDDING,II,The sacrifice that we denied.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Water and fire shall rot
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"The marred foundations we forgot,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Of sanctuary and choir.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,This is the death of water and fire.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,In the uncertain hour before the morning
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Near the ending of interminable night
LITTLE GIDDING,II,At the recurrent end of the unending
LITTLE GIDDING,II,After the dark dove with the flickering tongue
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Had passed below the horizon of his homing
LITTLE GIDDING,II,While the dead leaves still rattled on like tin
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Over the asphalt where no other sound was
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Between three districts whence the smoke arose
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"I met one walking, loitering and hurried"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,As if blown towards me like the metal leaves
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Before the urban dawn wind unresisting.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And as I fixed upon the down-turned face
LITTLE GIDDING,II,That pointed scrutiny with which we challenge
LITTLE GIDDING,II,The first-met stranger in the waning dusk
LITTLE GIDDING,II,I caught the sudden look of some dead master
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Both one and many; in the brown baked features
LITTLE GIDDING,II,The eyes of a familiar compound ghost
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Both intimate and unidentifiable.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"So I assumed a double part, and cried"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And heard another's voice cry: 'What! are you here?'
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Although we were not. I was still the same,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Knowing myself yet being someone other—
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed
LITTLE GIDDING,II,To compel the recognition they preceded.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"And so, compliant to the common wind,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Too strange to each other for misunderstanding,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,In concord at this intersection time
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Of meeting nowhere, no before and after,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,We trod the pavement in a dead patrol.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"I said: 'The wonder that I feel is easy,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"I may not comprehend, may not remember.'"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And he: 'I am not eager to rehearse
LITTLE GIDDING,II,My thoughts and theory which you have forgotten.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,These things have served their purpose: let them be.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"So with your own, and pray they be forgiven"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"By others, as I pray you to forgive"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,For last year's words belong to last year's language
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And next year's words await another voice.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"But, as the passage now presents no hindrance"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,To the spirit unappeased and peregrine
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Between two worlds become much like each other,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,So I find words I never thought to speak
LITTLE GIDDING,II,In streets I never thought I should revisit
LITTLE GIDDING,II,When I left my body on a distant shore.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,To purify the dialect of the tribe
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age
LITTLE GIDDING,II,To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"First, the cold friction of expiring sense"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Without enchantment, offering no promise"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit
LITTLE GIDDING,II,As body and soul begin to fall asunder.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Second, the conscious impotence of rage"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"At human folly, and the laceration"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"And last, the rending pain of re-enactment"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Of all that you have done, and been; the shame"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Of motives late revealed, and the awareness"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Of things ill done and done to others' harm
LITTLE GIDDING,II,Which once you took for exercise of virtue.
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains."
LITTLE GIDDING,II,From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"Where you must move in measure, like a dancer.'"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,The day was breaking. In the disfigured street
LITTLE GIDDING,II,"He left me, with a kind of valediction,"
LITTLE GIDDING,II,And faded on the blowing of the horn.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,There are three conditions which often look alike
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Yet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Attachment to self and to things and to persons, detachment"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"From self and from things and from persons; and, growing between them, indifference"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Which resembles the others as death resembles life,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Being between two lives—unflowering, between"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,The live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:
LITTLE GIDDING,III,For liberation—not less of love but expanding
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Of love beyond desire, and so liberation"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"From the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Begins as attachment to our own field of action
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And comes to find that action of little importance
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Though never indifferent. History may be servitude,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"History may be freedom. See, now they vanish,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"The faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved them,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"To become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern."
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Sin is Behovely, but"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"All shall be well, and"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,All manner of thing shall be well.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"If I think, again, of this place,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"And of people, not wholly commendable,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Of no immediate kin or kindness,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"But of some peculiar genius,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"All touched by a common genius,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,United in the strife which divided them;
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"If I think of a king at nightfall,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"Of three men, and more, on the scaffold"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And a few who died forgotten
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"In other places, here and abroad,"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And of one who died blind and quiet
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Why should we celebrate
LITTLE GIDDING,III,These dead men more than the dying?
LITTLE GIDDING,III,It is not to ring the bell backward
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Nor is it an incantation
LITTLE GIDDING,III,To summon the spectre of a Rose.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,We cannot revive old factions
LITTLE GIDDING,III,We cannot restore old policies
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Or follow an antique drum.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,"These men, and those who opposed them"
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And those whom they opposed
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Accept the constitution of silence
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And are folded in a single party.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,Whatever we inherit from the fortunate
LITTLE GIDDING,III,We have taken from the defeated
LITTLE GIDDING,III,What they had to leave us—a symbol:
LITTLE GIDDING,III,A symbol perfected in death.
LITTLE GIDDING,III,And all shall be well and
LITTLE GIDDING,III,All manner of thing shall be well
LITTLE GIDDING,III,By the purification of the motive
LITTLE GIDDING,III,In the ground of our beseeching.
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,The dove descending breaks the air
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,With flame of incandescent terror
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Of which the tongues declare
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,The one discharge from sin and error.
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,"The only hope, or else despair"
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Lies in the choice of pyre of pyre—
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,To be redeemed from fire by fire.
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Who then devised the torment? Love.
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Love is the unfamiliar Name
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Behind the hands that wove
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,The intolerable shirt of flame
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Which human power cannot remove.
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,"We only live, only suspire"
LITTLE GIDDING,IV,Consumed by either fire or fire.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,What we call the beginning is often the end
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And to make and end is to make a beginning.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,The end is where we start from. And every phrase
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Taking its place to support the others,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"An easy commerce of the old and the new,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"The common word exact without vulgarity,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"The formal word precise but not pedantic,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,The complete consort dancing together)
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Every poem an epitaph. And any action
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,We die with the dying:
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"See, they depart, and we go with them."
LITTLE GIDDING,V,We are born with the dead:
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"See, they return, and bring us with them."
LITTLE GIDDING,V,The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Are of equal duration. A people without history
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,History is now and England.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Calling
LITTLE GIDDING,V,We shall not cease from exploration
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And the end of all our exploring
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Will be to arrive where we started
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And know the place for the first time.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Through the unknown, unremembered gate"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,When the last of earth left to discover
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Is that which was the beginning;
LITTLE GIDDING,V,At the source of the longest river
LITTLE GIDDING,V,The voice of the hidden waterfall
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And the children in the apple-tree
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Not known, because not looked for"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"But heard, half-heard, in the stillness"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Between two waves of the sea.
LITTLE GIDDING,V,"Quick now, here, now, always—"
LITTLE GIDDING,V,A condition of complete simplicity
LITTLE GIDDING,V,(Costing not less than everything)
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And all shall be well and
LITTLE GIDDING,V,All manner of thing shall be well
LITTLE GIDDING,V,When the tongues of flame are in-folded
LITTLE GIDDING,V,Into the crowned knot of fire
LITTLE GIDDING,V,And the fire and the rose are one.
